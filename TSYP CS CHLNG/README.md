# How To Run:

Install metamask extension on your browser and create an account 

Go to metamask settings and add network then copy these network settings:

![metamask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20319127/146281989-4bde1cf6-148a-4864-bd24-af4e5d0d4a3d.png)

Network Name:

`Avalanche FUJI C-Chain`

New RPC URL:

`https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`

Chain ID:

`43113`

Currency Symbol(Optional):

`AVAX`

Block Explorer URL(Optional):

`https://testnet.snowtrace.io/`

Then go and select this network in the metamask extension.

(**)you can step these steps if you don't want to run the website locally, we hosted it on IPFS for you :) : //ipfs link goes here

[more on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/#how)

**install Node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Then run cmd: npm install http-server

**Go to the folder location (TSYP CS CHLNG) and cmd: http-server

you will have a metamask prompt. 

You can now verify if a document exist or not. If you need to add a document you should be an admin.

Thankfully I can add you as an admin, just give me your wallet address(copy it from metamask) and i'll take care of the rest :) 

WARNING!!!: Use this next step cautiously, don't use this private key for any real transaction.

import this account in metamask and use this private key, this account is admin : `4d9f23195a90321020068abe25b336f725bdc84602f8ea702040462e56649612`
