To run this you first need to install Node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Then run cmd: npm install http-server
Install metamask extension on your browser and create an account
Go to metamask settings and add network then copy these network settings:
Network Name:
Avalanche FUJI C-Chain
New RPC URL:
https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
Chain ID:
43113
Currency Symbol(Optional):
AVAX
Block Explorer URL(Optional):
https://testnet.snowtrace.io/

Then go and select this network in the metamask extension.
Go to the folder location and cmd: http-server
you will have a metamask prompt. 
You can now verify if a document exist or not. If you need to add a document you should be an admin.
Thankfully I can add you as an admin, just give me your wallet address(copy it from metamask) and i'll take care of the rest :)
